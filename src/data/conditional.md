# Conditional Branches

To execute a code based on a condition, we can use the `if ... else` statement:

```
if 10 < 100 {
    debug "It's true!";
}
```

Nested `if ... else` is also supported:

```
if true {
    if true {
        if true {
            debug "Is it really true?";
        }
    }
}
```
