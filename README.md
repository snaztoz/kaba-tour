# Tour de Kaba

Tour de Kaba is a website to showcase the features of Kaba programming language.

It provides an interactive compile-and-run workflow directly on the browser (without the need of any backend servers).

## Quickstart

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
